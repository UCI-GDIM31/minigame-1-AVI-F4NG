## Devlog
If a scene is a room, then the GameObjects would be individual items inside the room, for example but not limited to the chairs, tables, and laptop computers inside it. Components are the attributes of the items, some about its state - the chair is made of wood and its color is brown. Other Components would be about what the item can do - for example, the empty chair has the capability of granting one person a seat on it.
